## About StarOwl

StarOwl is a unique social media platform, designed with artists in mind. Our mission is to champion creativity, encouraging artists from all over the world to share their work, find inspiration, and connect with other creatives.

As indie developers, we built StarOwl from the ground up, focusing on providing the best possible tools for artistic expression and growth.
